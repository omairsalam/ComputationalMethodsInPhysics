# Computational Methods In Physics


This folder contains all the projects that I did for a Course called Computational Methods in Physics. All of these projects are written in mathematica and a few of them (Calculating Pi, Intoduction To Richmond Clustur - GLUON, Shooting the Sun and Random Walk also make use of the University of Richmond cluster called Gluon.

In order to use this cluster, there is a mathematica script on the cluster which "translates" the code that we write into that code that is required in order to be run on the cluster. That small script is not part of any of these files. 

<h2> Things to note </h2>
Mathematica is a scripting language that does not need to be compiled (obviously) so this code can simply be executed in real time for it to work. None of these files require any external dependencies. I do not believe that there is any way to execute Mathematica notebooks from the command line and so I do believe that you need to physically open them and then step through them for execution.
